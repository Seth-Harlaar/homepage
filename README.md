- NHL scores widget does not currently work its just filler data from Nov 9
- gif is made by Pixel Jeff: https://pixeljeff.tumblr.com/ 


### many things to change
- layout overhaul, current one relies too heavily on cards
- add more animations
- make the NHL scores widget work
- make more widgets: wheather, calender, others?


New layout is going to look something like this: (made with MS paint btw)

- the bar on the left will be bookmarks and will be a drawer that expands on hover to see title of bookmarks
- the bar on the bottom will be for widgets that will appear underneat the search bar only once the widget's corresponding button is press
